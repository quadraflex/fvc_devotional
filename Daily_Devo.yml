    Our Father in heaven,
    hallowed be your name;
    your kingdom come;
    your will be done, on earth as it is in heaven.
    Give us this day our daily bread.
    And forgive us our debts, as we forgive our debtors.
    And lead us not into temptation but deliver us from evil.
    For yours is the kingdom, and the power,
    and the glory, forever. Amen.

    I charge you in the presence of God, who gives life to all things, and of Christ Jesus, who in his testimony before Pontius Pilate made the good confession, to keep the commandment unstained and free from reproach until the appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ, which he will display at the proper time— he who is the blessed and only Sovereign, the King of kings and Lord of lords, who alone has immortality, who dwells in unapproachable light, whom no one has ever seen or can see. To him be honor and eternal dominion. Amen. (1 Timothy 6:13-16)

    Bless the Lord, O my soul, and all that is within me, bless his holy name. Bless the Lord, O my soul, and forget not the good he has done to me, who forgives all your sins and heals all your infirmities, who redeems your life from destruction, who crowns you with grace and mercy. The Lord is merciful, patient, and of great goodness. He does not deal with us according to our sins, nor does he repay us according to our offense. For as high as the heaven is above the earth, he shows his grace toward those who fear him. As far as the rising of the sun is from its setting, so far he removes our transgression from us. As a father takes pity on his children, so the Lord takes pity on those who fear him. Who also did not spare his own Son, but has delivered him up for us all and has given us with him all things. In this way, God shows his love toward us, that Christ died for us while we were still sinners. So we will all the more be saved by him from wrath, after we have been justified by his blood. For if we are reconciled to God by the death of his Son while we were still enemies, how much more will we be saved by his life, after we have been reconciled to him. Therefore, my mouth and heart shall proclaim the Lord's praise, from now on and forevermore. Amen. <I>Zacharius Ursinus</I>

    You, Lord, are patience, and pity, and sweetness, and love; therefore we sons of men are not consumed. You have exalted your mercy above all things, and have made our salvation, not our punishment, your glory; so that there, where sin abounded, not death, but grace superabounded. Accordingly, where we had sinned beyond any help in heaven or earth, then you said, "Lo, I come!" Then did the Lord of life, unable of himself to die, contrive to do it. He took flesh, he wept, he died; for his enemies he died; even for those that derided him then, and still despise him. Blessed Savior! Many waters could not quench your love, nor no pit overwhelm it. But, though the streams of your blood were coursing through darkness, grave, and hell, yet by these your conflicts, and seemingly hazards, did you arise triumphant, and therein made us victorious.

He made his flesh and blood into true food for us, and by his death he brought us to eternal life. He is the Lamb of God, the reconciliation for our sin, the only and perfect pledge of grace. For if God gave us his dear Son, and delivered him unto death for us, he will nevermore forsake us, but from then on be gracious, faithful, and merciful. Therefore, my mouth and heart shall proclaim the praise of the Lord and highly exalt him. And all men shall praise his goodness and mercy forever, through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen. <I>Heinrich Bullinger</I>

    O you high and holy One that inhabits eternity, you are to be feared and loved by all your servants. All your works praise you, O God; and we especially give thanks unto you for your marvelous love in Christ Jesus, by whom you have reconciled the world to yourself. You have given exceeding great and precious promises. You have sealed them with his blood. You have confirmed them by his resurrection and ascension, and the coming of the Holy Spirit. We thank you that you have given us so many happy opportunities of knowing the truth as it is in Jesus, even the mystery which was hid from ages and generations, but is now revealed to them that believe. Amen. <I>John Wesley</I>

    If you had not been my shield and defense, innumerable evils would have surrounded me and danger would have overcome me, that I could not have left my bed and risen in health - therefore it becomes me to praise my God. Early do I seek you, and in the morning shall my prayer ascend unto you, that you would this day preserve me and all mine, from the devices and power of the devil, from sin and shame, and from all evil.

    Be joyful in the Lord, all you lands. Serve the Lord with gladness, and come before his presence with a song. Be sure that the Lord is God. It is he that made us, and not we ourselves; we are his people, and the sheep of his pasture. O go your way into his gates with thanksgiving, and into his courts with praise. Be thankful to him, and speak good of his name. For the Lord is gracious, his mercy is everlasting; and his truth endures from generation to generation. Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit. As it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be, world without end. Amen. <I>Book of Common Prayer (1552)</I>

  Adoration: |
    We bless your name, O Lord, as those that are redeemed from death and hell! As those who are advanced to the dignity of sons! As those whom you save from all their enemies, but especially from ourselves, and from our sins. We bless your name, as those who are entering into glory, and hope to be with Christ forever, where sin and sorrow, enemies and fears, shall be shut out, and shall molest our souls no more forever! We foresee, by faith, that happy day! We see, by faith, the New Jerusalem! The innumerable angels! The perfected spirits of the just! Their glorious light! Their flaming love! Their perfect harmony! We hear, by faith, their joyful songs of thanks and praise. Lately they were as low and sad as we; in sins and sorrows, in manifold weaknesses, sufferings, and fears! But by faith and patience, they have overcome! And in faith and patience we desire to follow our Lord and them! The time is near! This flesh will quickly turn to dust, and our delivered souls shall come to you! Our life is short, and our sins and sorrows will be short! Then we shall have sight! We shall no more groan and cry out in darkness, O that we could know the Lord! Then shall we love you with pure, unmixed, perfect love, and need no more to groan and cry. O that our souls were inflamed with your love! Then shall we praise you with thankful cheerful readiness and joy, which will exceed our present apprehensions and desires! Amen. <I>Richard Baxter</I>

    11 Then I looked again, and I heard the voices of thousands and millions of angels around the throne and of the living beings and the elders. 12 And they sang in a mighty chorus:
    “Worthy is the Lamb who was slaughtered—
    to receive power and riches
    and wisdom and strength
    and honor and glory and blessing.”
    13 And then I heard every creature in heaven and on earth and under the earth and in the sea. They sang:
    “Blessing and honor and glory and power
    belong to the one sitting on the throne
    and to the Lamb forever and ever.”
    <I>Revelation 5:11-13</I>
  Adoration: |
    Kindness flows from you, Lord, pure and continual. You had cast us off, as was only just, but mercifully you forgave us; you hated us and you were reconciled to us, you cursed us and you blessed us; you banished us from paradise, and you called us back again; you took from us the fig leaves that had made us so unseemly a garment, and you put on us a cloak of great value; you opened the prison gates and gave the condemned a pardon; you sprinkled us with clean water and washed away the dirt. Never again, after all this, will Adam blush when you call him, never will he try to hide because his conscience reproaches him, never will he seek concealment under the trees in the garden. The flaming sword will nevermore whirl about the walls of paradise and cut off the entrance from those who approach it. For us that were heirs to his sin, all has been changed to rejoicing; for man now has access to paradise and even to heaven itself. The whole creation, heaven and earth, is at one again in friendship, its former ifferences forgotten; men join their voices with the angels and echo the angels' praise of God... There is no doubt who it is that dresses the bride in her finery: it is, of course, Christ-he that is and was and will be. Blessed is he, now and throughout the ages. Amen. <I>Gregory of Nyssa</I>

    25 Whom have I in heaven but you?
    I desire you more than anything on earth.
    26 My health may fail, and my spirit may grow weak,
    but God remains the strength of my heart;
    he is mine forever.
    <I>Psalm 73:25-26</I>
  Adoration: |
    Lord, what is my confidence which I have in this life? Is it not you, O Lord, my God, whose mercies are without number? Where has it ever been well with me without you, or where could it be ill with me, when you were present? I rather choose to be a pilgrim on earth, than without you to possess heaven. Where you are, there is heaven; and where you are not, there is death and hell. There is none that can help me in my necessities, but only you, my God; you are my hope, you my confidence. Although you expose me to diverse temptations and adversities, yet you order all this to my advantage; in which trial of me you ought no less to be loved and praised, than if you did fill me full of heavenly consolations. Amen. <I>Thomas à Kempis</I>
